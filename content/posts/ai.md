I wonder if AI will change what languages people programming in. Ive seen better result with more stringent languages such as rust vs dynamic typed languages. Maybe as the examples online that the LLM can learn on is of better quality in languages that have stricter compilers. If this is true, and since AI gives a huge benefit then would this mean that we will start seeing stricter languages such as rust higher in the rankings vs other languages and will we even see new languages developed with AI in mind? Just a interesting thought, and if you have a startup today or are about to select a new language to learn maybe something to take into consideration.
