Asset management is one of the first things you need to do when starting your security program to understand what assets you need to protect. Together with what data you have. Usually called the "crown jewels" but there is another way of looking at this. Not saying assets and data is not important but one thing that usually get overlooked is processes and what i like to call "follow the money". If you are building something, have a company and one or more products you might have processes for the customer in place that are more sensitive then others. These can be explored and understood to find attack vectors and i believe is a very effeicent way to start protecting your company. Example in a bank or similar wallet you might have payout functionality. Sending money out from your business. These processes are big red flags as this is what a attacker would like to do but it don't always have to be payout functions. In games like world of warcraft etc, gold selling and abuse of your platform was the big thing. Where bad guys selling ingame currency on a 3e party website for real currency to your customers. While not as bad as theft, might have big repuational and compliance issues if people missuse your platform in ways that was not intended. So follow the money is usually a good strategy and brainstorm how you could abuse your product to get money. EOT
